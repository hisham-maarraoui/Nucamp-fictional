I worked on this code as part of a coding bootcamp curriculum. 
     
I only followed along with the instructions (i.e. followed/copied instructions from the course and didn't design things from scratch myself) while writing code in this project. 

Moreover, I acknowledge receiving support from and/or working/collaborating with instructors/classmates, generally as is expected from being a participant in the coding bootcamp.
